# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Prior to the start of a Coding Bootcamp course, you can almost assure that there will be lots and lots of notes to be taking down. Being a person who is very unfamiliar with the world of coding, I needed to have a place where I could not only store my notes. Keeping my notes organized would be essential to me as well. With the creation of this application, I have created a place where I can record my notes as well as keep them organized. When the time comes to study for a test or to recall a topic I'm unsure about, the functions of the application will allow me to go directly to where I need go to find the answers.

## Usage

With the creation of the Prework Study Guide, I was able to create individual areas for the various topics I went over to input notes. There were four topics on this particular project: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. Within each topics area I was allowed to add as much information as I needed to. In the end I was able to open Devtools console and see Javascript running. I was able to see the topics that I went over and it had a feature that showed which topic I should study first.
